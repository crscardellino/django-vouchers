This is a simple app to add vouchers support to your Django Project.

The idea is to define Forms for any kind of voucher that you want and add them to settings.VOUCHERS variable.

e.g:
VOUCHERS = [('tshirt', 'project.vouchers.VoucherTShirtForm')]

and then define in project/vouchers.py something like:


from voucher.form import BaseVoucherForm

TSHIRT_SIZE = (('s', 'S'), ('m', 'M'), ('l', 'L'), ('xl', 'XL'), ('2xl', 'XXL'))

class VoucherTShirtForm(BaseVoucherForm):
    size = forms.ChoiceField(choices=TSHIRT_SIZE)
    address = forms.CharField(max_length=200)
    email = forms.EmailField()
